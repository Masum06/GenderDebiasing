Zimbabwe just can not seem to solve the PER_1 conundrum .
The left - arm spinner has taken 13 wickets in the three matches so far , and Zimbabwe coach PER_1 has said after <|coref|> his/her PER_1 batsmen were having technical problems in playing PER_2 .
Dhaka , Dec 9 ( bdnews24.com ) -- Zimbabwe just can not seem to solve the PER_1 conundrum .
The left - arm spinner has taken 13 wickets in the three matches so far , and Zimbabwe coach PER_1 has said after <|coref|> his/her PER_1 batsmen were having technical problems in playing PER_2 .
The problem seems to be an over - reliance on PER_1 and PER_2 .
PER_1 said the most pleasing thing about the previous match was the performance of <|coref|> his/her PER_1 fast bowlers .
<|alias|> PER_1 and <|alias|> PER_1 had taken just one wicket between them in the first two games , but combined to pick up five in the third .
PER_1 's offspin and PER_2 's left - arm spin were Zimbabwe 's main bowling threats on the slow Mirpur track . After his/her 67 in the third match , Zimbabwe may consider pushing PER_1 up the order .
PER_1 took a career - best 4 for 43 in the previous match . Ahead of the fourth game , <|coref|> he/she PER_1 said <|coref|> he/she PER_1 has bowled as fast as 143 kph in the nets .
With PER_1 easing into rhythm on <|coref|> his/her PER_1 return from injury , PER_2 has another chance to establish <|coref|> himself/herself PER_2 as Bangladesh 's lead seamer .
PER_1 said the surface was turning when Bangladesh practiced on it before the series , while PER_2 expected 240 to 250 to be a good score .
Teams PER_1 , who missed the previous game with a groin strain , trained with the team on Wednesday , but is doubtful for Friday 's match .
" When I was fielding I felt sore , " PER_1 said on Wednesday .
PER_1 replaced PER_2 for the third ODI but only scored 3 , so <|coref|> he/she PER_1 could be dropped again . Zimbabwe ( possible ) : 1 PER_3 , 2 PER_4 , 3 PER_5 , 4 .
The record is currently jointly held by PER_1 who took 15 in five matches against Zimbabwe in November 2008 , Zimbabwe 's PER_2 against Kenya in January 2009 and PER_3 himself/herself against Zimbabwe in October 2009 .
PER_1 is now Zimbabwe 's fourth highest wicket - taker in ODIs and needs three more to catch up with PER_2 .
" The last time I came here , PER_1 used to bowl straight but this time <|coref|> he/she PER_1 seems to be varying them , turning them , and it 's just a matter of watching the ball closely .
We just have to try and play with the spin and cover our stumps , " said PER_1 while talking about <|coref|> his/her PER_1 belief that denying PER_2 wickets could be the key for Zimbabwe .
Replacing PER_1 for the third Test is the easy part for Australia .
bdnews24.com , Dec 9 ( bdnews24.com ) – Replacing PER_1 for the third Test is the easy part for Australia .
PER_1 , who scored 86 not out in his/her last Test in March , is the leading candidate to come in for PER_2 on December 16 , while PER_3 would also be a capable choice .
PER_1 's experiment with PER_2 failed over two Tests , with the left - arm spinner taking three wickets at 102 and causing more trouble for the scorers than any batsman .
PER_1 is in form after career - best figures for New South Wales last week , but returning to <|coref|> him/her PER_1 so soon would require a serious selection back - flip .
PER_1 , the legspinning allrounder , took four wickets at the SCG on Tuesday , but <|coref|> he/she PER_1 is not yet qualified at Test level as a batsman or a bowler .
PER_1 said PER_2 " hit the wall " during England 's 5 for 620 declared , so the left - armer will be the first quick out .
The step up in class that the tourists provided showed PER_1 was workmanlike rather than exceptional , and Australia currently have two superior men in that regard in PER_2 and PER_3 .
PER_1 was Australia 's best bowler in the second Test , taking 2 for 84 , and will be a starter in Perth as long as <|coref|> his/her PER_1 wonky knee holds up .
