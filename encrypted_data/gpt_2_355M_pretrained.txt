What are your thoughts on the way Apple's iOS platform has changed over the past few years?
I think there's been a lot of progress. I think the software ecosystem is much better. I think Apple has moved into a place where they're moving in the right direction. But I also think the software has gotten worse.
That's why it's frustrating because iOS is a good thing. It's a great platform for getting the users to do things. But it's really hard
A pair of steps in the Houston area are now being touted as a potential way to ease traffic congestion in the area.
The projects are being touted as "high-speed rail" projects that would connect Houston to the East Bay, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
The first of the projects is the Houston St. Francis project, which would connect the city's downtown to the East Bay and San Francisco Bay Area.
The project would also connect the East Bay to Houston via the

The State Department announced today that it has awarded a $1.25 million contract to Infowars.com, the website that is widely considered to be a front for Russian intelligence.
The contract, awarded to the Washington, D.C.-based Infowars.com, is part of the U.S. Department of State's efforts to "develop and maintain a credible information infrastructure that allows the U.S. government to engage in critical national security missions with a greater degree of confidence," according to the announcement.
The contract was awarded to Infowars.com, which is based in Washington, D.C., and was initially announced by State Department spokesman Mark Toner.
In an interview with Breitbart News in December, Infowars.com founder Alex Jones explained that he and his crew are paid by Russian intelligence to provide "independent" news reports on a wide range of topics.
"Infowars has been providing a voice in the alternative media space for the last decade," Jones said. "We have a media presence that is able to reach a broader audience than any other outlet in the United States, and we are able to provide coverage of a wide variety of topics."

"It's absolutely crazy," he said. "I've been doing this for a long time and I have never seen a government, corporate entity that would give away a contract like this."
Jones, who is also the founder of Infowars.com, told Breitbart News that the "fake news" that is being peddled by the mainstream media is "sick."
"It's a game of chicken where the mainstream media is so desperate to control the narrative, that they're going to give anything to make it happen," he said. "I think it's really sick. I think it's really a violation of the First Amendment. I think it's an absolute violation of the Constitution."
Jones also said that Infowars.com is not connected to the Russian government.
"We are not connected to any government, no," he said. "We are not a news agency. We are not even a front group, we are not a front group that is just sitting around and making money off of this."
Jones is also the founder of Infowars.com's parent company, the InfoWars.com.

Police say a woman and her boyfriend had sex with a man and then left him for dead, according to WYFF-TV.
The couple was sitting in their car outside a restaurant in New Haven, Connecticut, when they were approached by a man who told them to get out of the vehicle. The couple told police they told the man to stop, but he kept going.
When the couple decided to leave, the man grabbed their vehicle, ripped out the window and got into the driver's seat.
He then drove off and jumped into a ditch.
The couple returned to the restaurant and the man was found by police.
He told police that he had sex with the woman before he died, according to WYFF.
Police say the man was identified as 28-year-old Jarell Preston.
The couple faces multiple charges including first-degree murder, first-degree sexual assault and criminal use of a vehicle to commit rape.<|endoftext|>Description

There are more than 60,000 households in the city of Edmonton with mortgages, according to the city's financial statements.
If the average household's debt is $150,000, that means Edmonton is a city of more than 6,000 homeowners.
Some of the homeowners whose debts are higher than $150,000 are struggling to pay off their mortgages and have to turn to payday lenders.
The city's latest monthly income report shows that an average of $53.47 per person in the city is below the poverty line.
The city's financial statements show that the median household income in Edmonton is $65,829.
"We're definitely in a rental housing situation. We're renting out the homes," said City Manager John Stewart.
"We have a lot of homeowners who are in debt. They're not making enough to pay it off."
The city says about 1,300 of its homeowners are in default on their mortgage, and another 1,400 are in default on their other mortgage.
The city's property tax bill is about $28 million a year, and the debt service on its credit card is about $40 million.
The city says the financial situation is dire, and it wants to help the homeowners.
"We're looking for ways to help them out," said Stewart.
The city is offering a $100,000 loan to anyone who is in default on their mortgage.
The city says the money will be used to help homeowners who are in default on their mortgage repay their debt, and to help them purchase a home.
The city says it hopes to have the money in place in January.<|endoftext|>The hunt for the elusive black widow spider is on.
A new study shows that the spider, which is native to South Africa, is almost extinct in the Western Cape province of South Africa.
Researchers from the University of Cape Town and the University of Cape Town's Department of Entomology and Nematology looked at the spider's population in the region. They found that the population was significantly smaller than previously thought.
"This is the first time that we have been able to demonstrate the extent of this decline in the Western Cape, and we have also been able to show that it is quite severe," said study author Dr. David Malhotra, a professor of entomology and Nematology at the University of

I've heard rumors that Apple is working on a phone with an 8-inch display, but it's not clear if the company is going to make a phone with a 9.7-inch screen or even 10-inch display.
So, the iPhone X is likely going to be a 12.9-inch phone, but we don't know how big the screen is going to be. So far, the iPhone X has been rumored to have a 5.5-inch screen and a 7.9-inch display.
For now, the most important thing about the iPhone X is that it will be a bit bigger than the iPhone 8, which was the biggest iPhone yet. Apple has said that it's looking to make

"One of the things that we're going to have to do as an industry is to develop a set of tools to make it easier to send information and data in a manner that is secure and privacy conscious," said Mark Graham, director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation's digital rights project. "It's not just about the security of data."
That means using encryption to protect data in data centers, which many data centers are now doing in a bid to protect customers' privacy and control the use of the data they store.
The EFF said the new bill would allow companies to encrypt and store data in "particular ways," and would prohibit companies from storing data for more than 24 hours.
The bill also would require that companies must store data for at least 24 hours in an encrypted form, or encrypt and store data in a way that would prevent the companies from gaining access to the data, Graham said.
The bill would also require the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to develop a blueprint to design secure, encrypted, and encrypted-encrypted data centers.
The bill would also require companies to report to the Department of Homeland Security data breaches.
The bill would require companies to provide "identity" to customers when they are asked to provide personal information.
Companies could not use their own encryption systems to protect the information they store.
The bill also would require companies to have "notice" for the first time about any data breach.
The bill would also require companies to have notice about any data breach that results in unauthorized access to the data.
The bill would require companies to establish "clear and reasonable" cybersecurity policies, and would require the federal government to ensure that companies are complying with those policies.
The bill would require the federal government to report on the success of its cybersecurity policies.
The bill would require the federal government to make its cybersecurity policies publicly available to the public and to provide the public with the text of those policies, including information on how to report data breaches to the federal government.
The bill would require the federal government to establish a "cybersecurity information sharing" program with state and local governments to facilitate sharing of cyber threat information.
The bill would require the federal government to provide $30 million to the U.S. Department of Defense to develop a comprehensive plan for cybersecurity.

It's been a busy week for the San Francisco 49ers, who went through some significant roster changes with the addition of veteran defensive end Chris Borland to the roster.
The 49ers have now added four new starters to the defensive line, and one of them is former Pro Bowl defensive end, Chris Borland.
Borland, 26, spent the past two seasons with the Denver Broncos, playing three seasons with the club. He played the last seven seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs, and was a Pro Bowler in 2013.
"I think Chris brings a lot to the table as far as leadership and leadership qualities," 49ers general manager Trent Baalke told NFL.com. "I think he brings a lot of leadership to the table. He's got a lot of leadership skills. He's got a lot of toughness, and he's a guy that really brings it every day."
Borland had been the 49ers starting nose tackle for the past two seasons, but was cut during training camp by the Broncos. Borland signed with the Kansas City Chiefs in the offseason, and was a solid rotational player.
He was expected to be a major contributor for the Chiefs, but he's now in San Francisco. He was a member of the 49ers' 2013 Pro Bowl defensive line, which was led by defensive end Justin Smith, and was one of the team's best.
In addition to the addition of Borland, the 49ers also have the signing of guard Billy Winn to a two-year deal. Winn spent the past two seasons with the New York Giants.
Winn is a former first-round pick of the San Francisco 49ers in 2010. He was released by the Giants in 2013, and spent last season on the Broncos practice squad.
The 49ers have also signed free agent defensive tackle, Alex Boone to a one-year deal. Boone spent the past two seasons with the Seattle Seahawks, and was a member of the team's 2011 Super Bowl championship team.
The 49ers have also signed free agent linebacker Sean Smith to a one-year deal. Smith was a member of the 49ers' 2013 Super Bowl championship team.

There is a lot of debate about the impact of the Iran nuclear deal on Iran's economy. But the biggest story of the week was the deal's impact on Iran's oil exports.
Iran's oil exports fell by 8 percent in 2016, according to the World Bank, and the reason for the drop is that Iranian crude exports were reduced by 25 percent.
Iran's economy is estimated to be worth $50 billion, which is less than the value of the U.S. economy. It is estimated that the Iranian economy will shrink by 7.3 percent this year. That is about the same as the U.S. economy.
The U.S. is the world's largest oil consumer, so when Iran's economy shrinks, the U.S. is going to have to import oil more. And that is going to hurt the U.S. economy.
Iran is already suffering from a shortage of oil, and its economy will be hurt even more if it cannot sell its oil at a profit.
As we mentioned before, the U.S. economy is growing at an annual rate of 3.5 percent. That is not good. And the U.S. is going to have to import oil more. And that is going to hurt the U.S. economy.
The U.S. is not alone. Iran is also struggling. The International Monetary Fund estimates that Iran's economy will shrink by 10 percent this year, and that is before accounting for inflation. That is going to hurt the U.S. economy.
U.S. President Donald Trump has made it clear that he wants to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The wall is not going to make America great again.
The U.S. economy is growing at an annual rate of 3.5 percent. That is not good. And the U.S. is going to have to import oil more. And that is going to hurt the U.S. economy.
When we talk about the Iran nuclear deal, the deal is going to have an impact on the U.S. economy.
The deal allows Iran to import up to 8,000 barrels per day of oil, which is about 2,300 barrels per day more than what Iran was getting before the deal. So, the deal makes it possible for Iran to export oil at a profit.

US President Donald Trump has said he would visit China in November if he wins the election.
Mr Trump said he had a "great relationship" with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
China says it will continue to insist it is not meddling in the US election.
China has been closely watching the US presidential race.
Mr Trump, who was in Beijing on Saturday for a G20 summit, said: "I have great relationships with China, with Japan, with other countries. And if I win the election, I'll be meeting with President Xi."
He said he wanted to start a "great, great relationship" with China, which is one of the world's largest economies.
"We are going to be building a great, great wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it," he said.
Mr Trump's campaign claims that China is stealing US jobs.
The US and China have a tense relationship. China is America's biggest trading partner, and has been a major customer of US goods.
US President Barack Obama accused China of economic "stealing" in his first foreign policy speech.
Mr Trump has said he would not negotiate with Beijing over trade issues, although he has said he would seek to strengthen the US-China relationship.
The US-China border in Nansha, the country's largest city, is a large and busy area.

The UK will keep its nuclear deterrent in the event of a nuclear-armed Russia, defence secretary Philip Hammond has said.
The announcement comes after Mr Hammond said it was the UK's "commitment to Nato".
He said the UK's nuclear deterrent was not in the UK's "national interest".
Russia has said it would not use nuclear weapons in the event of a war.
Analysis - Jon Sopel, BBC defence correspondent
The UK's defence secretary Philip Hammond said it was "absolutely right" to keep the UK's nuclear deterrent in the event of a nuclear-armed Russia.
But he added that the UK would "never again" be obliged to commit to the treaty that guarantees a nuclear-free world.
The UK's nuclear deterrent was not in the UK's national interest, he said, and the UK would never again be "forced to accept nuclear weapons in the event of a nuclear conflict".
It is not clear whether the UK would have to commit to the treaty, which it has signed but which Russia says is not binding.
Mr Hammond said he believed that the UK should remain "a strong, reliable and committed ally of Nato".
'Not in national interest'
The defence secretary said the UK was "not a member of the nuclear club" and he was confident the UK would be able to "engage in a constructive and constructive dialogue" with Russia.
But he said it was "right" that the UK's nuclear deterrent was not in the country's "national interest".
In a letter to the House of Commons, Mr Hammond said the UK's nuclear deterrent was "not in the national interest" and that it was "not in the national interest of the UK" to join the treaty.
The letter also said the UK's nuclear deterrent was not in the UK's "national interest as a deterrent to a nuclear attack".
The letter was published by the Foreign Office in response to a parliamentary question.
It says the UK had already fulfilled its commitment to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and that the "nuclear deterrent in the UK is not in the national interest as a deterrent to a nuclear attack".

The Earth is not round, but it does have an area of around 4,600 square kilometers. This is only a tiny fraction of the total area of the planet, but it is still a lot.
How much of this is Earth's surface?
If you are a believer in the fact that the Earth is a flat planet, then you can consider that it has only a 1/5th of the area of a typical globe.
The Earth has an area of 4,600 square kilometers. This is only a tiny fraction of the total area of the planet.
The surface area of the Earth is about 4,600 square kilometers.
This means that the entire surface of the Earth is about 400 square kilometers, or roughly the area of Ireland.
In other words, the entire surface of the Earth is only about 4,600 square kilometers.

The following article is from the April 2008 issue of Wired magazine.
"The Internet is a place where people can express themselves freely, and the Internet has created a new space for people to express themselves freely, and it's created a space for people to express themselves in ways that are not necessarily what they think they want to express," says Steve Loomis, an executive vice president at Microsoft, who served as chief executive from 1999 to 2005. "I think the Internet has been a catalyst for really innovative ideas."
Loomis, who has been with Microsoft since 1997, is in the middle of a project that will allow people to share their ideas and thoughts on the Internet through a new online hub, called Microsoft Ideas. The hub is a free, online community for ideas and discussion, and it will have a place for ideas on social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and Google+.
The hub, which Loomis says has been in the works for some time, will have a special purpose: it will be a place for ideas to be shared. "Ideas are very difficult to publish," says Loomis. "You have to make them personal and personalize them."
The hub will allow ideas to be shared for free, even for private messages. Ideas can be shared with one another, and ideas can be publicly posted. Ideas are also "free" from the pressure of being published, said Loomis. "Ideas are not required to be published. They're not limited to being published."
Loomis was speaking at the annual Microsoft Innovation Forum in San Francisco, the first of its kind. "What we are doing here today is creating a space where people can express themselves freely and be connected to each other in a way that they never would have been before," he said.
Loomis said that Microsoft Ideas will allow people to create new kinds of digital content that are not being published, and that he believes that the hub will be a very useful and helpful place to try out new ideas.
Microsoft Ideas will allow people to create new kinds of digital content that are not being published.
The hub will also allow people to communicate with each other and with other people. "We are looking at a couple of different ways that we can give people the opportunity to communicate with each other," said Loomis. Microsoft Ideas will have a central place for those types of communication, he added.

"I am the final Jedi. I will destroy the Dark Side and bring peace to this world." ―Darth Vader [src]
Darth Vader was a male Jedi Master who served as Darth Sidious' Sith apprentice during the Great Sith War. He was one of the Dark Lords of the Sith, but was ultimately killed by Sidious after he had learned of the Dark Jedi's plans. Vader was the only known Sith Master to have survived the war.
Vader was a Force-sensitive, Force-sensitive Human male who was born in the planet of Raxus Prime on the planet of Vjun.[1] He was the son of Vader's former master, Master Krennic, and was raised by his father to be the greatest warrior of his generation. He had a natural affinity for the Force and was trained by his father to be a Jedi Knight. He also had the ability to turn into a stormtrooper, a maneuver used by Darth Vader in combat. He became a Jedi Master when he was twelve years old.[1]
Sidious' death Edit
"Do not be afraid. I will bring peace to this world. We shall be together." ―Darth Vader [src]
At the age of sixteen years, Vader was in the middle of a battle with the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. Sidious had been searching for a way to defeat the Jedi, and was hunting down his own apprentice, Darth Vader. Vader was one of Sidious' greatest and most powerful opponents, and was also a powerful duelist.[1]
The United States has more than 50,000 chemical weapons in Iraq, and more than 40,000 in Syria, according to a recent report by the New America Foundation.
The report also found that Iraqi forces, backed by U.S. airstrikes, have killed more than 600 ISIS fighters and seized more than 30,000 weapons, including some of the deadliest weapons in the history of warfare.
"We should all be concerned about the level of violence and death that we're seeing on both sides of the border," said Max Abrahms, senior fellow at the New America Foundation. "It's a terrible time for us to be in."
The U.S. has said it has about 3,000 troops in Iraq and about 10,000 in Syria.
The report also pointed out that the U.S. has not captured a single ISIS commander in Iraq, and that the group is now believed to have lost about 1,000 fighters in the last few weeks.

More than 1,000 U.S. troops are in Iraq and about 2,000 in Syria, where they are training Iraqi forces to retake the city of Mosul.
The number of Americans fighting with ISIS has grown in recent months. U.S. officials say they have killed at least 20 fighters in Iraq since the start of the war against ISIS in 2014.
The U.S. has said it is about to send in 300 more troops to help in the fight against ISIS, and to advise and train Iraqi forces.

The report comes on the heels of a separate report by The Wall Street Journal, which said that the U.S. has been sending weapons to Kurdish fighters in northern Iraq, who have been helping the Kurds battle ISIS.
The New America Foundation report found that the U.S. is "significantly oversupplying" with weapons to the Kurdish fighters in Iraq.
The report said the U.S. has been sending weapons to the Kurds at a rate of about 1,500 a month.
"That's a lot of weapons," said Abrahms. "There's a lot of talk about what's going on in Iraq right now, but we've got over a million U.S. troops there and we

Washington, D.C. – The Republican Party of Texas is calling for a nationwide boycott of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, saying the Republican presidential nominee is the "most divisive, ignorant and dangerous candidate ever to seek the White House."
"I'm calling on all Republicans to boycott Donald Trump's presidential campaign," state GOP Chairman Craig Estes told Fox News. "He is the most divisive, ignorant and dangerous candidate ever to seek the White House. He is unfit for the office and has proven time and time again he cannot win."
Estes was speaking at the national Republican Party Convention on Saturday, where he announced the state's boycott of the Republican presidential candidate.
"I am a proud Republican, and I am disgusted with the way Donald Trump is running his campaign," Estes said. "I am calling on all Republicans to take action to stop Donald Trump from becoming president."
The RNC is urging its members to begin voting early on Tuesday, Oct. 26, in Texas, according to the official RNC website.
"Donald Trump is the most divisive, ignorant and dangerous candidate ever to seek the White House," Estes added. "He is unfit for the office and has proven time and time again he cannot win."
According to the Texas Tribune, Trump's fundraising has been on the decline since he became the presumptive Republican nominee in May, and his fundraising has been largely driven by the Republican National Committee.
"It is time for Republicans to stop supporting a man who has failed them time and time again," said state GOP Chairman Matt Rinaldi. "The only way we can prevent Donald Trump from becoming president is to stop supporting him."
The RNC has released a list of their top five presidential candidates, and the candidate with the highest name recognition in each of those rankings is Trump, according to the Texas Tribune.
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
In addition to the state Republican Party, the RNC also plans to hold a vote for Texas governor on Tuesday, Oct. 26.<|endoftext|>When I was about 10 years old, I started to read the Bible. I'd read the Old Testament before my brother and I even knew what a Bible was. I was a Catholic, but the Bible was my favorite thing. I loved the stories and the religious themes. I loved the stories. And I loved the stories so much that I
The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Medicaid, said in a statement Thursday that the program has already seen a decline in spending due to rising costs, and that the agency is "committed to working with states to ensure that states can meet the Medicaid goals set forth in the Affordable Care Act."
The Medicaid program covers about 85 percent of low-income people who live in states that have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. It's a program that was expanded under President Barack Obama to cover more than half of all low-income people, and expanded again in 2013 to cover more than 40 million people.
The agency said that the Trump administration's proposed budget would reduce funding for Medicaid by $880 billion over the next decade.
The budget would also eliminate federal support for health insurance programs that provide health insurance to low-income Americans. The cuts would take effect in 2020, and would reduce federal funding for health care programs that help low-income people get health insurance through Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers about 11 million children under age 18.
The House passed the American Health Care Act last week, which would repeal the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, cut the budget for the Children's Health Insurance Program and expand the eligibility for Medicaid.
The bill also would end the federal government's Medicaid expansion, which covers about 15 million low-income people, and would end funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers about 11 million children under age 18.
The House passed the American Health Care Act last week, which would repeal the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, cut the budget for the Children's Health Insurance Program and expand the eligibility for Medicaid.
The proposal would also require states to enroll Medicaid recipients in the federal health insurance marketplace. It would also require states to provide their residents with an income-based subsidy to help them afford private health insurance.

It was a moment of triumph for the nation's youth when the public school system of Southern California was given an overdue break from the scourge of failed charter schools and moved into the 21st century. But as the tide of state funding rolls out, many of the state's most troubled schools are finding themselves in a state of financial crisis.
The Los Angeles Unified School District, for instance, is in the midst of a $1 billion financial crisis.
After nearly a decade of public money being poured into the district, it has fallen into a financial pit that will be hard to turn around without a massive infusion of new money.
A $9 billion budget deficit and a $1.5 billion unfunded pension liability are just two of the problems facing the district, which has been plagued by a string of scandals and has seen enrollment decline for decades.
It is also facing a $20 billion deficit that will keep growing unless the district's board of education, which is controlled by an elected board of trustees, takes drastic steps to stem the bleeding.
The financial crisis and school funding woes are just a few of the issues plaguing the Los Angeles Unified School District, which was awarded $43 million in state funding in 2003 and has a $31 billion budget deficit.
"It's hard to see how this can be resolved," said Joseph Lasagna, an education professor at the University of Southern California and author of "The Last School of the Future: A History of Public School Funding in America."
"You have to understand that there are a lot of other problems that need to be addressed," he added.
In recent years, the Los Angeles Unified School District has been grappling with a range of problems, including the staggering number of student absences that has forced the school to cut classes and limit instructional time.
The district has also been grappling with a $25 million budget deficit that is largely tied to a $10 million tax levy levied on the district's commercial property.
The tax levy was supposed to be paid with the money from the tax on commercial property, but the money was never paid, and the district is now on the hook for about $20 million of the tax.
The district's charter schools, which receive taxpayer-subsidized funding from the state, are in dire straits.
The charter schools, which are often run by private companies, have been accused of failing to provide
The annual scientific conference on climate change is now in full swing. On Wednesday, dozens of scientists will meet to discuss their work and to share ideas on how to reduce global warming.
The science conference has been held annually since 1992, and it's expected to be the largest gathering of its kind in the United States.
It's also a moment of great tension. In the run-up to the conference, the Obama administration has been trying to convince the international community to hold climate talks that would curb global warming, and Obama has made it clear that he wants to see the conference become a "test case for whether the United States can lead on climate change."
This year's conference has been one of the most contentious in recent history.
More than 30 countries have signed on to the Paris Agreement, which commits major nations to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, nearly 200 nations, including the United States, are also committing to limit their greenhouse gas emissions to below 2005 levels.
But the U.S. and other countries have a lot of work to do to reach the target of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, a goal that's a lot higher than the 2 degrees needed to avoid dangerous climate change.
To reach the goal, the United States has to reduce its emissions by around 40 percent below 2005 levels by 2050, and by around 40 percent by 2100. The U.S. has already cut emissions by about 40 percent since the mid-1970s.
In the past few years, President Obama has worked to slow down the pace of climate change, and he has also been working to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. But at the same time, he's pushed the United States to cut back on other greenhouse gas emissions, including the burning of coal and oil.
But the United States has also worked to get international leaders to agree on the science of climate change, and the scientists attending Wednesday's conference are committed to doing their part.
In a joint statement released on Wednesday, the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society said they were excited about the upcoming conference.
"Our shared goals in the global climate change debate are to reduce greenhouse gases and ensure that our climate is stable and resilient to the impacts of human activities," the statement said. "We hope that this meeting will help advance the conversation and create a framework for future collaboration."
The Maine Department of Health and Human Services has a new plan for treating marijuana and other drugs.
The department will soon begin making recommendations to state lawmakers about how to regulate the medical and recreational use of marijuana, according to the department's statement.
The department will work with the Legislature and the Maine Legalization Committee to establish a framework for how Maine will regulate medical marijuana.
Under the plan, the department would establish a framework for the medical use of marijuana, a framework for the recreational use of marijuana, and a framework for the regulation of the use of marijuana.
The framework would be reviewed by the Legislature and the Legalization Committee and recommendations would be made by the Legislative Council.
Maine has one of the strictest medical marijuana laws in the nation. Under the law, anyone 21 and older with a doctor's recommendation can possess up to an ounce of marijuana and grow up to six marijuana plants in their home.
The bill would allow people 21 and older to grow up to two marijuana plants in their home and cultivate up to six plants in their home.
In addition, patients would be able to possess up to two ounces of marijuana and grow up to six marijuana plants in their home.
The bill would also require that all cannabis grown by patients be labeled with a drug-impaired driving warning label and that growers provide the same level of training for caregivers.
In addition, patients would have to submit a list of their caregiver's names and contact information.
The bill would also make it a misdemeanor for anyone to grow or possess more than an ounce of marijuana and would make it a felony to sell or give it away.
The bill also would establish a system for collecting and analyzing data on the use of marijuana in Maine and create a mechanism to update the list of medical marijuana patients.
The bill would establish a task force to look into the issue of marijuana abuse, the department said.

It was released in late 1980 and was manufactured by McDonnell Douglas under license from Lockheed Martin. It had a nose with a larger forward f-pitch than the F-15's, and was slightly more maneuverable.
It's a sad day for fans of the Dwayne Johnson comedy classic, "Saving Private Ryan," when it was revealed that Johnson has had his name removed from the title of the film.
In a statement released by the studio on Thursday, Lionsgate said that Johnson has been suspended from the film. "We have learned that the film 'Saving Private Ryan' has been removed from distribution because of allegations of plagiarism," the studio said. "We are extremely disappointed in Mr. Johnson's actions and the way he has handled the situation."
The decision came after a year of controversy, with Johnson, who starred in the original film, apologizing for his role in the film and accepting a two-year suspension from the Academy Awards.
In an interview with E! Online, Johnson said that the film had been "overwhelmed by attention," adding, "It's a little too much attention, but it's not all that much."
Johnson's agent, Mark Geragos, said in a statement that the "Saving Private Ryan" star had "overlooked" the comments made by the studio. "Dwayne's apology, which we believe is heartfelt, is sincere," Geragos said. "We understand his disappointment that his name was removed from the title and we respect his right to express it, but we are very concerned by the type of attention this has caused.
"The movie has sold more than 2 million copies worldwide and has been praised for its comedy and heart."
According to Variety, Johnson's agent added that the star has been working on a new film with his brother and that the studio had not yet decided whether to release the film.
Johnson's "Saving Private Ryan" is a comedy about the years leading up to World War II, which was based on a true story of an American soldier who survived an assassination attempt in Vietnam. The film also starred Demi Moore, Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer Lopez. It's been a few days since the new version of the Apple Watch was released and I've been itching to check it out. I've been using the watch for a few weeks now, and I've been enjoying it as much as I can. I've been using it with my iPhone 6 and I've been using it with my iPhone 6 Plus, so there's no doubt that I'm very happy with the watch.
The data on the debt of the United States is in fact a poor measure of its fiscal health.
When you look at the overall debt, it is clear that the United States has about $20 trillion in outstanding debt. (And it's not even close to paying off the $16 trillion in outstanding debt.)
But the debt is only part of the story. The debt is also a result of the fact that we do not pay for the things we want.
You know who doesn't want to pay for anything? The people who own our debt.
This is the reality of the American economy. When the government takes in $1 trillion in debt, it is essentially saying, "I'm going to give you something in return. I'm going to give you a way to pay for this debt. I'm going to give you an idea of what you can expect to receive."
And that's just the debt.
When you look at the $19 trillion in outstanding debt, you'll find that it's about the same as what the United States had in 2000, when the economy was growing at about 3 percent.
But the U.S. economy is not growing at 3 percent. It's slowing down. It's contracting. It's down.
In fact, the U.S. economy has contracted by nearly 1 percent since the start of 2009.
The U.S. government has been borrowing more than it's taking in. And it's the debt that's been causing the pain.
The "new normal" of U.S. debt is that the U.S. government is spending more than it's taking in, and the debt is the result.
But the reason we're borrowing more than we're taking in is that our country is run by the very people who are responsible for our debt.
The top 1 percent of Americans own 80 percent of all U.S. debt.
The top 1 percent own 88 percent of all U.S. debt.
So, when the people who run our country take in more money than they're taking out, the only people who will pay for it are the people who own our debt.
